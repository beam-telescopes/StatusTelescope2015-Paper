For this work, data have been taken at the {DESY-II} test beam facilities~\cite{DESYtb}. 
% Test beam in general and at DESY
%Test beam facilities have shown up as working horses for detector development for LHC upgrades as well as the future linear colliders.
The DESY-II electron/positron synchrotron at the DESY site in Hamburg has a circumference of 292.8\,m and is mainly used as an injector for the PETRA-III storage ring. 
However, it also supplies beam to three test beam areas, one  of them being the test beam area~21.
%The circumference of the DESY-II ring is 292.8\,m. 
Its dipole magnets operate in a sinusoidal ramping mode with a frequency of 12.5\,Hz. 
Therefore, one DESY-II cycle takes 80\,ms, and the bunch length is around 30\,ps. 
% Principle of Test beam generation 
The DESY-II synchrotron is equipped with movable carbon fibres. 
If positioned in the beam, bremsstrahlung photons are created, escaping the beam line tangentially.
Subsequently, the photons are converted to electron/positron pairs on a secondary metal target. 
Their energy distribution reaches up to 6\,GeV. 
Using a dipole magnet, this secondary electron/positron beam is spread out.
A collimator can be used to select certain energy ranges of the beams reaching the experimental halls with an achievable rate of about $10$\,kHz to $100$\,kHz. 
%In optimal conditions, a maximal particle rate of $9$\,kHz at around 2.5\,GeV/$\cspeed$ can be reached. 
A more detailed description of the test beams at {DESY-II} can be found in~\cite{EUDET-2007-11}.

% CERN and SLAC
%In addition to measurements at DESY\,II, the beam telescopes were also characterised at other test beam facilities: 
%At CERN, the circular proton synchrotron SPS~\cite{SPS} of 6.9\,km length is the final injector of proton beams for the Large Hadron Collider. 
%Additionally, it provides a proton beam on three secondary targets resulting in a mixed beam (electrons, hadrons, muons) with energies between 5\,GeV to 205\,GeV
% feeding up to seven beam lines in the SPS North Area, one of them being the H6 beam line. 
%One beam spill contains up to $\sim 2\cdot10^8$\,particles and is 4.8\,s to 9.6\,s long. 
%A spill occurs every 14\,s to 48\,s depending on the operation mode.

%At SLAC, the Linac Coherent Light Source incorporates a primary electron beam with up to 13.6\,GeV and a repetition rate of 120\,Hz~\cite{SLAC}.
%Either this primary beam, or a secondary beam produced on a thin target can be sent to the End Station Test Beam (ESTB) with energies between 3.5\,GeV and 13.6\,GeV at 5\,Hz
% resulting in up to $10^{9}$ electrons per pulse.

%A beam pulse incorporates typically 109\,particles at 5\,Hz.\,\cite{d}
