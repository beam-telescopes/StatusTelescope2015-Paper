 
Successful telescope, in 2013 bla amount of users.
highly flexible and versatile set-up.
with \eudaq and \EUTelescope a powerful software package for data taking and data analysis has been developed. 
At DESY beam energies, a measured resolution of ... is achievable, and the intrinsic resolution of the \Mimosa sensors have been measured to 3.4 pm ...
Calculations predict a pointing resolution of 1.85 um on the DUT in a six planes set-up with X mm plane spacing, which well agrees wit a measured pointing resolution of 2.x pm .. um.
 
Then:\\ 

Future Eutel:
Support for tracking in presence of magnetic fields and a more fine-grained detector geometry description interface using ROOT::TGeo are currently under development.

Future EuDAQ:
New event format supporting multiple triggers per mimosa frame

Future TLU:
miniTLU supporting many other great things
