The data presented were taken in $2015$ using $\Datura$, a $\eudet$-type beam telescopes, which was operated with EUDAQ, cf.~section~3 and~4. 
The results presented in this section have been obtained using the EUTelescope software described in section~\ref{sec:offline}.
The set-up does not include any additional DUT, only six $\Mimosa$ telescope planes. 
Track fits are performed using the GBL formalism and track residuals, i.e.\ the distance between the track fit and the measured hit,
 are calculated for each telescope plane. 
 

\subsection{Data analysis flow}
\label{sec:datura-nodut}

After conversion from raw $\Mimosa$ data, a hot pixel search is performed marking pixels with firing frequencies above a certain threshold.
Clusters are formed from fired, adjacent pixels and translated from two-dimensional entities on the individual telescope planes into hits in a global three-dimensional reference frame.
Those clusters containing at least one hot pixel are removed from the analysis. 
Track triplets are built from hits in the three upstream and three downstream planes separately: 
A straight line from one hit in each outward plane (plane\,0 and 2, plane\,3 and 5) is combined with a matching hit in the centre plane of the upstream or downstream trio, i.e. plane\,1 or plane\,4. 
Triplet isolation is ensured by rejecting all triplets whose extrapolation features distances to other triplet extrapolations that fall below $\unit{300}{\upmu\meter}$ at a chosen $z$-coordinate.
The $z$-coordinate chosen is the centre between plane\,2 and plane\,3. 
Matching triplets are identified by isolated triplets that intersect at $\zdut$ within a square with edge length smaller than $\unit{100}{\upmu\meter}$. 
In turn, GBL tracks are formed by the six hits belonging to the matched triplets. 
For offline alignment the GBL tracks are passed to Millepede-II in order to determine shift and rotation alignment constants for every telescope plane.
After applying the alignment constants, the above track finding is repeated, and the final GBL tracks are calculated. 
These tracks can be formed in a \textrm{biased} or in an \textrm{unbiased} form, where biased tracks include the measured hit information of every plane in contrast to unbiased tracks,
 that omit the hit information of the plane under investigation. 
Additionally, the tracking efficiency for the $\Mimosa$ sensors is calculated. 

\subsection{Multiple scattering and residuals}
\label{sec:resmultiple}

The figure of merit for a beam telescope is its track resolution\footnote{also called pointing resolution} $\sigmatb$ ($\sigmatu$).
It defines the precision with which a particle trajectory can be determined for an biased (unbiased) track. 
This quantity is a function of the track path, i.e.\ it is not constant along the trajectory. 
%The timing resolution is largely dependent on the readout speed of the used sensors, their buffer sizes and the data acquisition system. 
It depends on the intrinsic resolution $\sigmai$ of the sensors, that have been used to measure the hits belonging to the track, the number of hit measurements and their positions
 as well as the multiple scattering of the beam particles.
Various methods exist to perform the calculation of the track resolution. 
In the formalism of GBL, the track resolution results from a single, global $\chi^2$-fit of a track model to all measured hits including their measurement uncertainties (intrinsic resolution)
 and scattering angle uncertainties along the trajectory. 
% 
%The resolution of a telescope $\sigma_{\textrm{Tel}}$ can be expressed by
%
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:telescopepointing}
%\sigma_{\textrm{Tel}}^2 = k \cdot \sigmai^2
%\end{equation}
%
%\noindent
% with the geometric scaling factor $k$ in turn written as
%
%\begin{equation}
% k = \frac{\sum_i^N z_i^2}{N \cdot \sum_i^N z_i^2 - \left( \sum_i^N z_i \right)^2} \,,
%\end{equation}
%
%\noindent
% assuming all $N$ telescope planes have the same intrinsic resolution $\sigmai$. 
%The distance of the $i$-th telescope plane to the DUT positioned at $z=0$ is then $z_i$ .
%For a symmetric set-up with the DUT at the centre of the telescope and the up- and downstream planes equally spaced, $k$ reduces to $k = 1/N$. 
%
Multiple Coulomb scattering is the term used to describe the deflection of a charged particle traversing any medium.
The angular scattering distribution is centred around $0$
 and the width depends on the particle energy, particle type and the radiation length of the matter traversed~\cite{ref:scatteringhighland}.
An approximation for high energy protons, that is accurate to 11\,\% for all atomic numbers $Z$, yields a closed form for the distribution width in the transverse plane~\cite{ref:PDG-2014}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:multiplescattering}
\Theta_{0} = \frac{13.6\,\mega\electronvolt}{\beta c p} \cdot z
\sqrt{\varepsilon}
\cdot \left( 1 + 0.038 \ln{\left( \varepsilon \right) } \right) \,,
\end{equation}

\noindent with the velocity $\beta c$, the momentum $p$ and the charge number $z$ of the traversing particle. 
The expression $\epsilon = x \per X_0$ is the material budget, as defined in section~\ref{sec:sensors}.
%
Equation~(\ref{eq:multiplescattering}) shows the advantage of using thin sensors, since the angular deflection due to multiple scattering increases with material budget.
This is especially important at low-energy beams, such as the DESY-II test beam, as the distortion increases towards lower energies.
As the beam particles interact with the sensors and the air, contributions to the amount of multiple scattering from both have to be considered.
At high-energy hadron beams, the contribution from multiple scattering can in general be neglected. 
 
The biased (unbiased) residual defined as a quantity per track is the spacing between the measured hit and the biased (unbiased) track fit. 
With a known or estimated biased track resolution, i.e.\ all $\sigmai(z_i)$ are known or estimates exist,
 the width of the distribution of the biased residuals for a set of tracks can be expressed for all positions $z = z_i$ as

\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:telescoperesolutionequation1}
 \rbiased^2(z) = \sigmai^2(z) - \sigmatb^2(z).
\end{equation}

\noindent
If the hit measurement of a DUT at $\zdut$ or of a telescope plane at position $z_i$ is not included in the fit,
 the width of the distribution of the unbiased residuals at these positions reads~\cite{ref:eudetreport200902}
 
\begin{equation}
\runbiased^2(z) = \sigmai^2(z) + \sigmatu^2(z).
\label{eq:telescoperesolutionequation2} 
\end{equation}

\noindent
Both the biased and the unbiased residual distributions are a function of the track resolution and therefore have the same dependencies.
It should be noted that the unbiased track resolution at a sensor plane can be larger than the intrinsic resolution. 
On the contrary, the biased track resolution is always smaller than or equal to the intrinsic resolution at the sensor planes. 

The biased pull of a track is defined as the ratio of the biased residual over the predicted biased residual width

\begin{equation}
 \textrm{pull}_{\textrm{b}} \equiv \pb = \frac{\rbiased}{\sqrt{\sigmai^2 - \sigmatb^2}}.
 \label{eq:pull}
\end{equation}

\noindent
The biased pull distributions are normally distributed and centred at 0 with a width of 1, if the material and the scattering therein is known and correctly described. 
A width larger than one results from an underestimated residual prediction $\sqrt{\sigmai^2 - \sigmatb^2}$, which in turn stems from either an underestimated intrinsic resolution
 or an overestimated track resolution. 
The latter is caused by either an overestimated material budget or overestimated deflection angles. 


A critical aspect of this analysis is the choice between biased and unbiased residuals. 
In principal, both choices lead to compatible results if the material in the beam and the deflection due to multiple scattering therein is correctly described. 
%With biased residuals, only one fit has to be performed, whereas for unbiased residuals, a new fit has to be formed for every plane under investigation. 
The impact of systematic uncertainties on the result, however, is different, as more information is used in the biased track fits. 
The material thicknesses and the amount of multiple scattering therein are only known with a certain accuracy affecting the track resolution, and thereby also the predicted residual width, 
 and hence the derived intrinsic resolution. 
%Especially the Highland formula is only accurate to about 11\,\%. 
If the pulls distribution resembles $N(0,1)$, equations~(\ref{eq:telescoperesolutionequation1}) and~(\ref{eq:telescoperesolutionequation2}) hold and the systematic uncertainties of the intrinsic resolution
 are estimated by calculating the effect of uncertain beam energy and uncertain deflection angle using the GBL formalism. 
Firstly, the residuals have been obtained from data assuming an intrinsic resolution of $\sigmai = \unit{3.3}{\micro\meter}$ and secondly the track resolution is calculated. 
Finally, the intrinsic resolution is calculated as $\sigmai = \sqrt{\rbiased^2 + \sigmatb^2}$ or $\sigmai = \sqrt{\runbiased^2 - \sigmatu^2}$ for biased and unbiased track fits, respectively. 
The beam energy is varied by 5\,\% and the deflection angle by 10\,\%. 
All systematic uncertainty contributions for the two set-ups are listed in table~\ref{tab:uncerts} exemplary for plane\,0.
It shows, that the choice of biased track fits results in smaller systematic uncertainties compared to unbiased track fits. 
Additionally, there is a systematic uncertainty of the method itself, as it predicts slightly different intrinsic resolutions for each plane, which changes between geometries,
 i.e.\ it is not dominantly caused by an actual difference in intrinsic resolution. 
The spread in intrinsic resolution over all planes is 1\,\% and 2\,\% for the wide and the narrow geometry, respectively. 

\begin{table}[tbp]
 \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{r|r|c|c|c||c}

  \end{tabular}
    \caption[Systematic uncertainties for plane\,0]{Systematic uncertainties in determination of the intrinsic resolution for plane\,0, are listed for biased and unbiased track fits and the two geometries.
  For unbiased tracks in the wide geometry, the uncertainty of the intrinsic resolution could not be calculated as the measured residual is smaller than the calculated track resolution.}
  \label{tab:uncerts}
 \end{center}
\end{table}

The rather large uncertainty of the Highland formula and hence significant impact on the final results can be diminished: 
In case the Highland formula underestimates the actual straggling of beam particles in the given material, the predicted track resolution is systematically affected, and therefore the pull distribution. 
Hence, the estimator $\sigmahat$ does not converge towards the true $\sigmai$, but towards a larger value and vice versa. 
Since the intrinsic resolution is independent of the plane spacing $\dz$, a comparison at two precisely measured spacings allows for a calibration of $\Theta_0$ at a given beam energy. 
To this end, a global energy dependent factor $\kappa$ is introduced that is constant as a function of sensor threshold and geometry

\begin{equation}
 \Theta_{\textrm{corr}} = \kappa(E) \cdot \Theta_0.
 \label{eq:thetacorr}
\end{equation}

\noindent
The value $\kappa$ is found when the average of the intrinsic resolution over the six planes for one plane spacing matches the average of the intrinsic resolution for the other configuration. 
The uncertainty of $\kappa$ is defined as the range for which the average intrinsic resolution of one configuration equals the central value plus/minus one standard deviation of the other. 
If $\kappa$ differs significantly from one and/or depends on the beam energy is to be determined with data. 


\subsection{Performance measurements with DATURA}
\label{sec:measurements}

Measurements of particle trajectories were performed to verify the performance of the $\Datura$ telescope at various beam energies, sensor thresholds, and sensor spacings. %~\cite{ref:thomas}.
The biased track residual distributions have been obtained as described in sections~\ref{sec:datura-nodut} and~\ref{sec:resmultiple}. 
% By considering one telescope plane as a DUT, equation~(\ref{eq:telescoperesolutionequation}) is modified under the assumption that $\sigmai = \sigma_{\textrm{DUT}} = \sigma_{\textrm{M26}}$,
%  leading to
% 
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:telescoperesolutionequation_2}
% \sigmameas^2 = \sigma_{\textrm{M26}}^2 \cdot \left( 1 + k_5 \right) +
% \sigma_{\textrm{MS}}^2\,,
% \end{equation}
Additionally, the biased pull distributions are calculated for every sensor plane. 
Since the intrinsic resolution is not a priori known, an initial estimate of the intrinsic resolution $\sigmahat$ is used as an input to the GBL track fitting. 
The width of the pull distributions therefore differs from 1 and is iteratively used to update the estimate $\sigmahat$.
This procedure converges towards the true intrinsic resolution within the uncertainties and yields compatible results for the two different geometries for an appropriate choice of $\kappa$. 
It should be noted that the systematic uncertainty of the converged estimate is independent of the iteration process.
\footnote{I.e., an initial estimate close to the converged value does not yield smaller uncertainties on the converged value compared to a bad initial estimate.}
%A mismatch in intrinsic resolution for the two cases is corrected by varying $\kappa$, cf.~equation~(\ref{eq:thetacorr}) and repeating the iterative method until the intrinsic resolutions equal

\noindent
%with $k_5$ being the geometric scaling factor for a telescope consisting of five planes. 
%The value of $k_5$ depends on the geometry itself and on which telescope plane is considered as DUT. 
%This configuration with five planes used as beam telescope and one plane as DUT is referred to as \textit{gauge configuration}. 

Figure~\ref{fig:residualexample1} shows an example of converged biased residual distributions in $x$ for a telescope sensor spacing of $\dz = 20\,\milli\meter$,
 a beam energy of 6\,GeV, and a sensor threshold setting of $\noise = 6$. 
According results for the $y$-direction, further planes and the wide geometry are omitted. 
The distributions are fitted with a Gaussian, from which the residual width $\rbiased$ is determined. 
For plane\,3, the biased residual width averaged over the $x$- and $y$-direction is 

\begin{equation}
\left( .\,\pm\, \allowbreak . \right)\,\micro\meter. ?? 
\end{equation}

\noindent
It should be noted, that the residuals feature non-Gaussian tails, as is expected from the underlying physics of the scattering mechanism~\cite{ref:PDG-2014}. 
The measured resolution used in this work is defined as the width of a Gaussian fit on the centre $98.8\,\%$ (2.5 standard deviations) of the residual distribution.
The residual width for the outer plane\,0 is smaller than the width obtained from plane\,3.
This is expected due to the fact that the track extrapolation to the inner sensors is done from both sides, and hence is comparatively more precise than for the outer sensors,
 where the extrapolation can only be performed from one direction. 
Therefore, in equation~(\ref{eq:telescoperesolutionequation1}) the difference between $\sigmai$ and $\sigmatb$ decreases from the centre sensor planes to the outer ones.

The twelve measured residual widths for both the narrow plane spacing of $\dz = 20\,\milli\meter$ and the wide spacing of $\dz = 150\,\milli\meter$ are shown in figure~\ref{fig:smiley} (A) and (B)
 at a beam energy of 6\,GeV and a sensor threshold $\noise = 6$, respectively. 
The residuals at a considered plane $i$ are always smaller for the wide configuration in comparison to the narrow one. 
Also, the residuals decrease towards lower beam energies. 
These effects stem from the term $\sigmatb$ in equation~(\ref{eq:telescoperesolutionequation1}): 
(1) Qualitatively, the spatial uncertainty of the extrapolation to the next plane increases with larger lever arms $\dz$. 
(2) The biased track resolution tends towards the intrinsic resolution for increased scattering. 

%The energy dependent width of the scattering angle distribution increase the uncertainty with decreasing energy, c.f.\.equation~\ref{eq:multiplescattering}. 
%In the former term, the geometric scaling factor is larger in the wide configuration, in the latter $\sigma_{\textrm{MS}}$ increases with decreasing beam energy. 

%In order to find the best estimate of the intrinsic sensor resolution, a $\chi^2$ minimisation is performed. 
%Inputs to this minimisation are the twelve measured residuals widths $\sigmameas$ at a sensor threshold of $\noise = 6$ and a beam energy of 6\,GeV. 
%These are compared to analytical estimates of the residuals $\sigmahat$, which depend on the known geometry of the set-up, its material budget, the beam energy,
% and the intrinsic sensor resolution, cf.~equation~(\ref{eq:telescoperesolutionequation}). 
%The $\chi^2$ is calculated over all planes as
%
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:chi2_sigmai}
% \chi^2 = \sum_{i = 0}^{N-1} \left( \frac{\sigmahat_{i,x} - \sigma_{\textrm{meas},i,x}}{\sigma_{\sigmameas}} \right)^2 + 
% 				    \left( \frac{\sigmahat_{i,y} - \sigma_{\textrm{meas},i,y}}{\sigma_{\sigmameas}} \right)^2,
% \end{equation}

%\noindent
%with the uncertainty of the measured residuals $\sigma_{\sigmameas}$.
%The minimum of equation~(\ref{eq:chi2_sigmai}) with respect to $\sigmai$ is calculated in order to determine the intrinsic sensor resolution $\sigmai$.
%In both cases, an error of $0.5\,\milli\meter$ on the plane distance $\textrm{d}z$ is assumed. % This assumption is done for track fitting. Plane position is fixed in chi2 minimisation for \sigmai

The average intrinsic resolution of the $\Mimosa$ sensors at 6\,GeV and threshold $\noise = 6$ results to
\begin{equation}
 \sigma_{\textrm{M26}} = \left( .\,\pm\, \allowbreak . \right)\,\micro\meter.  
\end{equation}

\noindent
This average is taken over all twelve measured dimensions of the telescope and measurements at plane distances $\dz =  20\,\milli\meter$ and $\dz =  150\,\milli\meter$. 
%The average over the two configurations results in $\sigma_{\textrm{M26}} = \left( 3.43\,\pm\, \allowbreak 0.03 \right)\,\micro\meter$. 
%The stated uncertainty is the error on the mean, the standard deviation is $0.10\,\micro\meter$.
For both geometries, the expected resolution of $\sigmai \approx\,3.5\,\micro\meter$~\cite{ref:mimosa26} can be confirmed.
The following two assumptions have been made: 
Firstly, the multiple scattering terms described in equation~(\ref{eq:multiplescattering}) are calculated considering the measured sensor thicknesses, the air between sensor planes, and a $25\,\micro\meter$
thick Kapton foil on either side of each sensor.
%In equation~(\ref{eq:multiplescattering}), the nominal beam energy is used. 
Secondly, the intrinsic resolution $\sigmai$ of every sensor plane is assumed to be equal over the area of the sensor. 
%As the discriminator thresholds are set for a total of four subframes per plane individually, this is not necessarily true.
%Figure~\ref{fig:resivsenergy_thresh} shows the dependence of $\sigmai$ on the applied SNR threshold

%\item Residual widths are calculated using straight line tracks only.
%Inclined tracks, or a deflection of tracks in planes or scattering material, are not taken into account.
%However, as shown in~\cite{ref:lutzpaper}, angular deflections are then considered for the later $\chi^2$ minimisation.

The above method is repeated for different beam energies at a fixed threshold $\noise = 6$. 
This allows for the determination of $\kappa$ as a function of the beam energy. 
The correlation is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:HL_factor}. 
In the energy range covered, $\kappa$ is found to increase monotonically up to a value of 1.2 at 6\,GeV, which translates to a correction by 20\,\% in comparison to the Highland formula. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering

  \caption[HL Factor]{
  The global factor $\kappa$ to the Highland formula is plotted against beam energy.
  }
  \label{fig:HL_factor}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, the above described method has been repeated for various sensor thresholds.
The threshold applied to each telescope sensor is a critical parameter for the telescope performance.
A higher threshold reduces the amount of fired pixels which results in fewer clusters found on average on a plane and thus limiting the number of reconstructible tracks.
This reduces the sensor efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of reconstructed tracks that have at least one hit on the investigated plane within $d = 100\,\micro\meter$ to the overall number of tracks.
The margin $d$ is additionally scaled with the inverse energy and the plane distance $\dz$. 
In figure~\ref{fig:resivsenergy_thresh}~(A) the efficiency dependence on the sensor threshold is shown for various beam energies and sensor spacings.
Efficiencies are shown exemplary for plane 3. 
Statistical errors are negligible due to the large amount of tracks recorded.
Also, systematic uncertainties are insignificant due to precise alignment and sufficiently large margin $d$.  
For thresholds $\noise < 7$ the efficiency is above $98\,\%$. ??
With increasing threshold, the efficiency decreases until a level of $82\,\%$ at $\noise = 12$ is reached. ??
The efficiency varies by maximal 1\,\% between different set-ups and measurements.

The threshold level affects not only the efficiency, but also the intrinsic resolution. 
With an increased threshold, a hit is formed from smaller clusters which deteriorates its position estimate. 
A deterioration also occurs towards lower thresholds allowing for an increased number of noise induced signals to pass the zero-suppression on the chip.

\subsection{Pointing resolution predictions using General Broken Lines}

%The pointing resolution of a beam telescope represents the accuracy with which a track can be pointed on a DUT. 
% In case multiple scattering cannot be neglected, it can be expressed as
% \begin{equation}
%  \sigmap^2 = \sigma_{\textrm{Tel}}^2 + \sigma_{\textrm{MS}}^2
% \end{equation}
% 
% \noindent
Using the measured intrinsic resolution, the known material budget $\epsmimo = 7.6\cdot 10^{-4}$ of the sensor planes including the Kapton protection and the material budget of a DUT $\epsdut$,
 predictions of the expected pointing resolution at the actual DUT position $\zdut$ can be made. 
Therefore, it is possible to perform an a priori calculation of the optimal telescope geometry for a certain measurement set-up. 
In this section, $\zdut$ is assumed to be in the centre between plane\,2 and plane\,3.

%Pointing resolutions in this section refer to the achievable pointing resolution using a \textit{symmetric six M26 planes plus DUT} configuration. 
%This is referred to as \textit{user configuration}, also shown in figure~\ref{fig:datura_sketch}, while the set-up used in section~\ref{sec:measurements} is referred to as \textit{gauge configuration}. 

Using the GBL formalism, the pointing resolution is analytically calculated at desired points of interest along the particle trajectory. 
The pointing resolution at the DUT for four different DUT material budgets $\epsdut$ is depicted as a function of the spacing $\dzdut$ in figure~\ref{fig:CalcResos_dzdut}.
Exemplified are two values of $\dz = 20\,\milli\meter$ and $\dz = 150\,\milli\meter$. 
Plots are provided for (A) DESY-II and (B) SPS beam energies. 
For $\dz = \dzdut = 20\,\milli\meter$ at 5\,GeV beam energy the pointing resolution on the DUT is about 
\begin{equation}
 \sigmatb(\zdut) = (1.9\,\pm .)\,\upmu\meter
\end{equation}

\noindent
for $\epsdut = 0.001$. ?? Need error estimate here ?? !!
The uncertainty originates from an assumed uncertainties of 5\,\% on the beam energy and 10\,\% on the material budget. 
For SPS energies, a pointing resolution of $(1.4\pm . )\,\upmu\meter$ is predicted. ??
All shown resolution functions monotonically increase with increasing $\dzdut$. 
To achieve the best possible resolution, the inner $\Mimosa$ planes should be positioned as close as possible to the DUT, i.e.~$\dzdut$ is to be minimised. 
In addition, figure~\ref{fig:CalcResos_dzdut} shows, that the optimal plane spacing $\dz$ depends on the actual DUT size along the beam direction and its material budget.
For instance for a DUT with a material budget of $\epsdut = 0.001$ (solid lines) at 5\,GeV, a narrow configuration shows a higher resolution for $\dzdut < 70\,\milli\meter$,
 while a wide configuration is best for $\dzdut > 70\,\milli\meter$.
The intersection is marked with an arrow in figure~\ref{fig:CalcResos_dzdut}. 
The position of the intersection of the two lines depends on the material budget of the DUT $\epsdut$ and shifts with increasing material budget. 
%A DUT with a material budget of $\eps$
In the wide (narrow) configuration, the predicted pointing resolution on the DUT is about $2.4\,\upmu\meter$ ($1.9\,\upmu\meter$) at $\dzdut = 20\,\milli\meter$ for DUTs with $\epsdut = 0.001$.
At SPS energies, the resolution functions for the wide and the narrow configuration do not intersect, with the narrow configuration showing a slightly better
However, the difference is less than $0.5\,\micro\meter$ for $\zdut = 100\,\milli\meter$ even for $\epsdut = 0.03$.

% Using the \textit{gauge configuration}, a comparison between the GBL calculations and the measurements can be performed.
% For this, the measured resolution has to be converted to the pointing resolution $\sigmap$ by correcting for the intrinsic resolution of the DUT $\sigmadut = \sigmam$
% 
% \begin{equation}
%  \sigmap = \sqrt{\sigmameas^2 - \sigmadut^2}.
%  \label{eq:sigmap}
% \end{equation}
% 
% \noindent
% This is shown in figure~\ref{fig:CalcResoP_DUT} (A) as a function of the beam energy. 
% The solid lines represent GBL calculations, while the triangles show the derived $\sigmap$ obtained from equation~(\ref{eq:sigmap}). 
% The hatched bands represent the calculated pointing resolution assuming $\sigmam = 3.43\,\upmu\meter$ with a standard deviation of $0.10\,\upmu\meter$ for the wide and the narrow configuration. 
% An excellent agreement between GBL calculations and the measurements is found. 
% For the limit towards high energies, or negligible multiple scattering, a pointing resolution of $1.6\,\upmu\meter$ is predicted. 
% The measurement at 120\,GeV confirms the prediction, 

In figure~\ref{fig:CalcResoP_DUT} the achievable pointing resolution at $\zdut$ as a function of the material budget is shown at 5\,GeV.
%Again, a minimal $\dzdut$ allows for the best possible resolution. 
Dashed and solid lines represent calculations for $\dz = 20\,\milli\meter$ and $\dz = 150\,\milli\meter$, respectively. 
The optimal plane spacing $\dz$ depends on the actual size requirements for the DUT along the beam direction and its material budget.
For instance, for a DUT with a material budget of $\epsdut = 0.002$, a plane spacing of $\dz = 20\,\milli\meter$ should be used, if $\dzdut$ is as small as 20\,mm. 
However, a plane spacing of $\dz = 150\,\milli\meter$ is preferred, if $\dzdut$ is 60\,mm or larger. 
Intersections are marked with open circles. 
For $\epsdut$ below (above) the intersection, a narrow (wide) configuration is preferable. 
The position of the intersection shifts to smaller material budgets with increasing $\dzdut$.
