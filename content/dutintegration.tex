DUTs are integrated the same way as the telescope itself using either the RJ45 or the LEMO interface. 
An $xy\upphi$-stage is available for translation over the acceptance region and rotation of the DUT. 
The maximum DUT size when placed between the telescope arms is 500\,mm ?!.

Take note, that if straight line fitting is used, the inclusion of downstream planes might significantly deteriorate the unbiased residual widths,
 as kinks at the possibly thick DUT --- and also at the $\Mimosa$ planes themselves --- are not allowed for in the fit.
Therefore, using GBL for track fitting is recommended. 
If straight line fitting is used nonetheless, a fit using the upstream planes only might result in a better unbiased residual width, compared to a fit that includes the downstream planes.
However, in a narrow \textit{user} configuration using a 5\,GeV beam, the pointing resolution at the DUT using GBL is $1.83\,\upmu\meter$, compared to more than $3.88\,\upmu\meter$ using only the upstream planes.
N.B., that in later case, the optimal plane distance is a wide configuration with $\dz = 150\,\milli\meter$.
